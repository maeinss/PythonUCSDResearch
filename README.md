# PythonUCSDResearch
Contains the classes and functions I have coded for my research of manipulating 3D matrices
1. Operations.py  contains simple mathematical operations
2. Plot_operations.py contains Classes/functions for plotting of the 3D structure and dose.
3. Sectioning.py contains the segmentation methods for dividing a 3D matrix structure into subsections
4. Transformation.py contains the Torchio transformation for resizing, resampling, and transforming a structure by applying several deformation techniques.
